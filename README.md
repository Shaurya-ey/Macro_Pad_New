# Macro_Pad_New
Working on a Macropad (Beginner Build).
* Dimensions:- 89.050 x 83.469 mm

## About The Project

### Project Description
- This is a Custom built 3×4 macropad built using the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040
- Includes 12 mechanical keys and 1 rotary encoder
- It will help in multitasking, fast reflexes and especially for video editing, designing CAD models and Coding.
- This custom macropad can be switched between 3 modes, which are:
  - Coding
  - Video Editing
  - Cad Modelling 
- The 3 LED'S are there for depicting which we're in :-
  - RED   -> Video Editting
  - BLUE  -> CAD Modelling
  - GREEN -> Video Editting

### Why I Made This Project
- As i'm more into electronics, firmware development and soldering crazy stuffs.
- Wanted to learn something new like how to prepare schematics,routing for Pcb's.

### How to Use This Project
- Connect the macropad to your computer  theough a Type-C USB cable.
- The device is detected as a standard USB HID keyboard.
- The Keys and Rotary Encoder can be Reprogrammed for:
  - Shortcuts (i.e: Copy, paste shortcuts)
  - Music controls
  - Mode switching (Mine includes 3 modes)
- And for overall Firmware.
